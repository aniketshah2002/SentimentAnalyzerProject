## üß† How It Works

This project uses a [mention your model/library, e.g., pre-trained model from the VADER library, a custom Logistic Regression model, etc.] to perform sentiment analysis. The input text is first pre-processed to remove noise (like stop words and punctuation). Then, the cleaned text is passed to the model, which calculates a sentiment polarity score. Based on this score, the text is classified as positive, negative, or neutral.
