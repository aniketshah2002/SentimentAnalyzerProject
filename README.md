# SentimentAnalyzerProject
The project is designed to build a machine learning model that can automatically determine the sentiment (the feeling or emotion) of a piece of text.

Specifically, you will:
1. Use a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews, each labeled as either "positive" or "negative".
2. Write a Python script using libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.
3. Train a model (a Logistic Regression classifier) to learn the patterns of positive and negative language from the reviews.
4. Evaluate the model to see how accurately it can classify reviews it has never seen before.
5. Test the final model by giving it new, custom sentences to see if it correctly predicts their sentiment.

The end result is a program that can read a movie review and tell you if it's positive or negative.
